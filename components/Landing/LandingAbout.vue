          Hey ðŸ‘‹ ! I'm a french computer student in master degree known as Faceslog. I have always been passionate about technology and the endless possibilities it offers.
        </p>
        <p class="pb-4">
          I have a strong interest in reverse engineering, malware analysis, and cybersecurity. I love the challenge of deconstructing and understanding how systems work with the goal to find new ways to protect them from malicious attacks. I am constantly striving to learn more and stay up to date on the latest developments in these fields.
        </p>
        <p class="pb-4">
          I have also become increasingly aware of the importance of privacy in the digital age. That's why I try to self-host as many apps as possible. It allows me to have a much better control over my data and ensures that it is not being collected or sold to third parties without my consent. It may take more effort and technical know-how, but the peace of mind and security it provides is worth it.
        </p>
        <p class="pb-4">
          I am well aware that there is always more to learn and that I have much room for improvement. I am constantly seeking out new opportunities to learn and grow as a developer, and I am always open to suggestions and guidance from others. If anyone has any suggestions or resources that they think would be helpful for me or my projects, I am all ears !
        </p>
        <p class="pb-4">
          Outside of programming and studying I love photography and urban exploration of lost places which help me disconnect from our digital world and get an even better creative mindset.
        </p>
        <p class="pb-4">
          I'm happy to help those who are just starting and are looking for support.
        </p>
